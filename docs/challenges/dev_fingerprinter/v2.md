# Device Fingerprinter (DFP) v2 (Active after 2026 February 25 10:00 UTC)

## Overview

**Device Fingerprinter (DFP) v2** is a high-precision challenge focused on device identity consistency and uniqueness. Participants must develop a browser SDK capable of generating a "fingerprint" string that remains identical for the same physical device across multiple browsers while remaining unique between different devices.

The challenge evaluates your SDK's ability to resist browser-level variations (like user agents or window sizes) and extract hardware-level or deeper software signals that uniquely identify the hardware.

For general information and technical setup, please refer to the [Main README](./README.md).

## Mandatory Requirements

1. Use the template provided in the [`templates/commit/src/fingerprinter/`](./templates/commit/src/fingerprinter/fingerprinter.js) directory.
2. Implement your logic within the `fingerprinter.js` file.
3. Your SDK must:
   - Generate a single string (the "fingerprint").
   - Report this string to the evaluator when executed within a browser environment.
   - Be self-contained and not rely on external API calls or non-standard browser features that require user permissions (e.g., Camera/Microphone).

### Browsers

Your SDK will be evaluated across multiple mobile and desktop browsers, including:

- **Chrome**
- **Brave**
- **Firefox Focus**
- **DuckDuckGo**
- **Safari**

All browsers are run in incognito mode. Each device will be tested in multiple "batches" across these browsers to ensure consistency.

---

## Key Guidelines

- **Fragmentation (Internal Consistency)**: Your SDK must produce the same ID for a device even if the browser changes. If the ID changes between Chrome and Brave, you will be penalized for "Fragmentation."
- **Collision (External Uniqueness)**: Your SDK must produce different IDs for different physical devices. If two devices share the same ID, you will be penalized for "Collision" via the **Two-Strike Rule**.
- **Hardware Focus**: Avoid using volatile signals (like window size, battery level, or IP address) as they vary between browsers and sessions, leading to fragmentation penalties.

## Technical Architecture (Challenger & Proxy)

DFP v2 utilizes a two-tier architecture to ensure a realistic evaluation environment:

1. **Challenger API**: The "Brain" of the operation. It receives your submission, manages the test session, notifies physical devices via SMTP, and calculates the final score based on the data received.
2. **DFP Proxy**: The "Gateway." It hosts your `fingerprinter.js` script and acts as the collection point for device reports. This prevents direct communication between the test devices and the main Challenger, ensuring security and isolation.

### The Lifecycle of a Fingerprint

- **Submission**: You send your `fingerprinter.js` to the Challenger.
- **Distribution**: The Challenger automatically pushes your script to the Proxy.
- **Collection**: Physical devices visit the Proxy, execute your script, and send the results back to the Proxy.
- **Scoring**: The Proxy forwards the collected results to the Challenger for the final calculation.

---

## Mandatory Functions

Participants must implement and export two specific async functions in their `fingerprinter.js` script. These are the entry points used by the evaluation environment.

### 1. `runFingerprinting()`

This function is responsible for gathering device signals and generating the fingerprint hash.

- **Miner Requirement**: Miners must capture the exact 32-character string returned by this function and submit it unmodified.
- **Goal**: Collect hardware/software data and return a unique, consistent hash.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- **High Consistency**: Maintain the same fingerprint for a single device across all 5+ target browsers.
- **High Uniqueness**: Ensure no other physical device generates the same fingerprint.
- **Minimum Participation**: At least 2 physical devices must successfully report fingerprints for a session to be valid.
- **Stability**: The script must execute quickly and reliably within the evaluator's `fp_timeout` window.

---

## Scoring System

The final score is an average of the points earned by each physical device in the session, normalized between **0.0 and 1.0**.

### 1. Fragmentation Penalty

Each device starts with **1.0 point**.

- For every unique fingerprint string generated by the *same* device beyond the first, a penalty of **-0.3** is applied.
- **Max Fragmentation**: If a device generates **3 or more** different IDs across browsers, its score for the session is automatically **0.0**.

### 2. Two-Strike Collision Rule

This rule ensures your ID is unique across the network.

- **Strike 1**: If a fingerprint generated by a device is shared by *any* other physical device in **one** browser batch, a penalty of **-0.25** is applied.
- **Strike 2**: If the same collision happens in **2 or more** batches, that device's score becomes **0.0**.

### Scoring Example

Imagine a session with 2 devices across 5 browsers (10 batches total with `n_repeat=2`):

- **Device 1 (Perfect)**: Reports "ID-AAA" in all 10 batches.
  - Unique IDs: 1 (Penalty: 0)
  - Collisions: 0 (Penalty: 0)
  - **Points: 1.0**

- **Device 2 (Fragmented)**: Reports "ID-BBB" in 8 batches and "ID-CCC" in 2 batches.
  - Unique IDs: 2 (Penalty: -0.3)
  - Collisions: 0 (Penalty: 0)
  - **Points: 0.7**

- **Device 3 (Collided)**: Reports "ID-AAA" (Collides with Device 1) in 2 batches.
  - Unique IDs: 1 (Penalty: 0)
  - Collisions: 2 batches (Strike 2 triggered)
  - **Points: 0.0**

**Final Session Score**: `(1.0 + 0.7 + 0.0) / 3 = 0.567`

## Submission

After local validation using the [Testing Manual](./testing_manuals.md), package your script into a submission container. Ensure your `fingerprinter.js` is correctly placed in the miner template.
