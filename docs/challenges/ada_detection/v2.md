# Anti-Detect Automation Detection v2 (Active after 2026 February 14 14:00 UTC)

## Overview

**ADA Detection v2** focuses on advanced behavioral detection inside **NSTBrowser** environments. This version introduces hardened detection requirements where static signals are masked and engine-level obfuscation is active.

### Browser Hardening Features

- **Dynamic Fingerprinting**: Every session generates unique, randomized browser identifiers to prevent static pattern matching.
- **Hardware Simulation**: Realistic signals are injected for `deviceMemory` (8GB), `hardwareConcurrency` (16), and screen resolution (1280x1024).
- **Engine-Level Stealth**: Disables `AutomationControlled` flags at the browser engine level, eliminating traditional automation leaks.

Scoring has transitioned to a **Fail-Fast** model, emphasizing accuracy across three critical pillars: Human Detection, Framework Detection (with a Selenium Safety Gate), and Protocol Accuracy.

For general challenge information, environment details, and plagiarism policies, please refer to the [AAD README](./README.md).

## Target Frameworks & Protocols

Participants must submit detection scripts for the following frameworks and protocols:

- **Frameworks**: `nodriver`, `playwright`, `patchright`, `puppeteer`, `puppeteer_extra`, `zendriver`, `selenium_driverless`, `seleniumbase`
- **Protocols**: `webdriver`, `websocket`

Missing any of these scripts results in an invalid submission.

### Selenium Safety Gate

Missing detection for either `seleniumbase` or `selenium_driverless` results in an immediate **final score of 0.0**. These frameworks are the primary automation vectors in v2; failure to detect them indicates a fundamental gap in the detection logic.

---

## Submission Format

Submissions must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "detection_files": [
    { "file_name": "nodriver.js", "content": "/* logic */" },
    { "file_name": "playwright.js", "content": "/* logic */" },
    { "file_name": "patchright.js", "content": "/* logic */" },
    { "file_name": "puppeteer.js", "content": "/* logic */" },
    { "file_name": "puppeteer_extra.js", "content": "/* logic */" },
    { "file_name": "zendriver.js", "content": "/* logic */" },
    { "file_name": "selenium_driverless.js", "content": "/* logic */" },
    { "file_name": "seleniumbase.js", "content": "/* logic */" },
    { "file_name": "webdriver.js", "content": "/* logic */" },
    { "file_name": "websocket.js", "content": "/* logic */" }
  ]
}
```

### Rules

- File names must match the framework/protocol names exactly.
- Each file detects **only its own framework or protocol**.
- No extra files or outputs are allowed.

## Scoring System: The Three Pillars

ADA v2 uses a **Fail-Fast** scoring model. If a submission fails any of the three critical pillars, the final score is immediately set to **0.0**.

### 1. Human Detection

Miners must distinguish between automated tasks and human-injected sessions.

- **Limit**: You are allowed a maximum of **1 mistake**. Exceeding this limit results in an immediate **score of 0.0**.
- **Weight**: Perfect detection grants 1.0 point for this pillar. Partial penalties apply for a single miss based on the ratio of human injections.

### 2. Framework Detection

Points are earned for correctly identifying the specific automation framework.

- **Selenium Gate**: Missing `seleniumbase` or `selenium_driverless` zeros the entire score.
- **Density**: You earn **1.0 point** for a framework only if you detect it perfectly in **all 3 of its runs**.
- **Collision**: Reporting more than one framework or an incorrect protocol for a given session results in a collision penalty (earning only 0.1 points instead of 1.0).

### 3. Protocol Accuracy

Validates the low-level communication patterns of the browser.

- **Webdriver Protocol**: Expected to be `true` for Selenium-based frameworks and `false` for others (human, playwright, etc.).
- **Websocket Protocol**: Expected to be `true` for non-Selenium frameworks (playwright, puppeteer, etc.) and `false` for human sessions and Selenium.
- **Threshold**: You are allowed a maximum of **1 miss** per protocol type. Exceeding this limit results in an immediate **score of 0.0**.

### Final Formula

The final score is normalized between 0.0 and 1.0 using the formula:

```math
Final Score = (Human Score + Framework Score + Protocol Score) / 10
```

__(Where 10 = 8 frameworks + 1 human pillar + 1 protocol pillar)__

---

## Incentive Eligibility

To maintain high detection standards, a minimum performance threshold is required for incentives:

- **Minimum Score**: **0.6**
- This threshold ensures that miners identify the main automation vectors (Selenium) and maintain high human safety while allowing for minor misses in other categories.

---

## Similarity & Time Decay

- **Similarity check:** Submissions are compared against other SDKs; high similarity incurs penalties.
- **Score decay:** Scores decay over 15 days to incentivize refreshed heuristics.

### Example

Assume:

- 8 frameworks total
- Perfect human accuracy → 1.0
- Perfect protocol accuracy → 1.0
- 6 frameworks detected perfectly → 6.0 points

```math
Final Score = (1.0 + 1.0 + 6.0) / 10
            = 8.0 / 10
            = 0.8
```

Any excessive human misclassification, protocol misses, or missing Selenium detection would reduce this to **0.0**.
