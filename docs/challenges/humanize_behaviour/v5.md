# Humanize Behaviour v5 (Active after September 4th 2025 10:00 UTC)

## Overview

**Humanize Behaviour v5** tests bot scripts' ability to mimic human interaction with a web UI form with dynamic movements across different sessions. It evaluates behavior based on **mouse movement**, **keyboard interaction analysis**, and **mouse movement similarities over sessions**.

Miners must demonstrate precise, human-like interactions and ensure trajectories vary naturally between sessions.

For general challenge information, technical requirements, and plagiarism policies, please refer to the [Humanize Behaviour README](./README.md).

## Example Code

Example codes for Humanize Behaviour v5 can be found in the [`redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v5/`](https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/RedTeam/blob/main/redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v5/) directory.

### Core Requirements

1. Use our template from [`redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v5/src/bot/bot.py`](https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/RedTeam/blob/main/redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v5/src/bot/bot.py)
2. Keep the `run_bot()` function signature unchanged
3. Your bot must:
   - Work with the provided Selenium driver
   - Input text into designated fields
   - Scroll down to the end of the page
   - Click the designated button to end the session
   - Submit the form without errors

### Key Guidelines

- **Action Sequence**: Follow the provided `ACTIONS LIST` order. Clicking it at the start or in the middle will prematurely submit data and result in a zero score due to invalid action flow.
- **Click Behavior**:
    - Only click at specified locations
    - Additional clicks for input fields and submit buttons are allowed
    - Wrong click order will result in form submission failure.
- **Text Input**:
    - Locate fields by their `id`
    - Use text from the `ACTIONS LIST`
    - Maintain the specified input order
- **Page Interaction**:
    - After completing form inputs, scroll down to the end of the page
    - Click the designated button to properly end the session
- **Cross-Session Behavior Variation**:
    - Your bot must demonstrate different movement patterns across multiple evaluation sessions.
    - Similar movement patterns across sessions will be flagged as bot-like behavior.
- **Bezier Curve Detection**:
    - The system includes highly sensitive bezier curve detection.
    - Avoid smooth, mathematically perfect curves; use slightly irregular movement patterns.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your bot will be scored on these human-like behaviors:

- Mouse Movement Velocity Variation
- Mouse Movement Speed and Profiles
- Mouse Movement Granularity, Count, and Trajectory Linearity
- **Bezier Curve Detection (avoid smooth mathematical curves)**
- Keypress Behavior Pattern
- **Scroll Path Linearity (Scroll should be linear in single coordinate)**

### Testing Solutions
