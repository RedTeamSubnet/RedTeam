# Humanize Behaviour v2 (Active after March 18th 2025 14:00 UTC)

## Overview

**Humanize Behaviour v2** tests bot scripts' ability to mimic human interaction with a web UI form. It evaluates behavior based on **mouse movement** and **keyboard interaction analysis**.

For general challenge information, technical requirements, and plagiarism policies, please refer to the [Humanize Behaviour README](../README.md).

## Example Code

Example codes for the Humanize Behaviour v2 can be found in the [`redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v2/`](https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/RedTeam/blob/main/redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v2/) directory.

### Core Requirements

1. Use our template from [`redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v2/src/bot/bot.py`](https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/RedTeam/blob/main/redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v2/src/bot/bot.py)
2. Keep the `run_bot()` function signature unchanged
3. Your bot must:
   - Work with the provided Selenium driver
   - Follow the click sequence specified in `config`
   - Input text into designated fields
   - Submit the form without errors

### Key Guidelines

- **Action Sequence**: Follow the provided `config` order. Early submission clicks will result in a zero score.
- **Click Behavior**:
    - Only click at specified locations.
    - Additional clicks for input fields and submit buttons are allowed.
    - Wrong click order will result in form submission failure.
- **Text Input**:
    - Locate fields by their `id`.
    - Use text from the `config`.
    - Maintain the specified input order.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your bot will be scored on these human-like behaviors:

- Mouse Movement Velocity (Variation, Speed, Profiles)
- Mouse Movement Granularity, Count, and Trajectory Linearity
- Keypress Behavior Pattern

## Submission Guide

To build and submit your solution, please follow the [Building a Submission Commit](../../../miner/workflow/3.build-and-submit.md) guide.
