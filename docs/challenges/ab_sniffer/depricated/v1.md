# AB Sniffer v1 (Active after June 10th 2025 14:00 UTC)

## Overview

**AB Sniffer v1** tests miners' ability to develop a SDK that can detect and correctly identify automation frameworks by name.

For general challenge information, technical requirements, and plagiarism policies, please refer to the [AB Sniffer README](../README.md).

---

## Example Code

Example codes for the AB Sniffer v1 can be found in the [`redteam_core/miner/commits/ab_sniffer_v1/`](https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/RedTeam/blob/main/redteam_core/miner/commits/ab_sniffer_v1/) directory.

### Core Requirements

1. Use our template from [`redteam_core/miner/commits/ab_sniffer_v1/src/detection/detection.js`](https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/RedTeam/blob/main/redteam_core/miner/commits/ab_sniffer_v1/src/detection/detection.js)
2. Keep the detection function signature unchanged
3. Your SDK must:
   - Detect automation frameworks interacting with the page
   - Output the exact name of the detected tool
   - Work reliably across multiple execution modes

### Target Frameworks

Your SDK should be capable of detecting these automation frameworks:

- **nodriver**
- **selenium**  
- **seleniumbase**
- **patchright**

### Key Guidelines

- **Limitations**
    - Your script must not exceed 1,000 lines. If it does, it will be considered invalid, and you will receive a score of zero.
    - Your dependencies must be older than January 1, 2025. Any package released on or after this date will not be accepted, and your script will not be processed.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your SDK will be scored based on:

- **Detection Accuracy**: Correctly identifying automation frameworks by name
- **Consistency**: Maintaining accuracy across multiple test runs
- **Coverage**: Number of frameworks successfully detected
- **Minimum Requirement**: Must detect at least 2 of the 4 frameworks with 100% accuracy to qualify

### Scoring System

- **Per Framework**: Points awarded for consistent detection
- **Minimum Threshold**: Must achieve minimum score to rank on leaderboard
