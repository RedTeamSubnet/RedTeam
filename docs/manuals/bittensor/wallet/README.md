## 🧊 Coldkey vs. 🔥 Hotkey

To participate in the Bittensor network, you need two types of wallets: **coldkey** and **hotkey**.

- **Coldkey**: This is a secure, offline wallet used to hold TAO tokens and make important administrative decisions. Think of it as your "savings account."
- **Hotkey**: A wallet used for day-to-day operations like mining. This is more like your "checking account," used for frequent transactions but not for storing large amounts of TAO.
