# 5. 🛰 Monitor and Reward

You need to monitor your submitted solution and reward based on its performance in the RedTeam Subnet. This guide outlines the steps to monitor your solution and claim rewards.

## Prerequisites

- [**1. Preparation**](./1.preparation.md)
- [**2. Develop Solution**](./2.develop-solution.md)
- [**3. Build and Publish**](./3.build-and-publish.md)
- [**4. Submit Commit**](./4.submit-commit.md)

## 5.1. Monitor your commit submission

- Visit the [**RedTeam Dashboard**](https://dashboard.theredteam.io) to monitor your miner's performance, score, and our evaluation system feedback.
- See [**dashboard documentation**](../concepts/dashboard.md) to understand the metrics and feedbacks provided.
- Check miner status on RedTeam Subnet:

```sh
# Check subnet seat info:
btcli subnet show --netuid 61

# Check miner wallet status:
btcli wallet overview \
    --wallet-path ~/.bittensor/wallets \
    --wallet-name my_wallet \
    --wallet-hotkey my_hotkey \
    --netuid 61 \
    --verbose
```

## 5.2. Optimize your solution

- Check submission analysis and feedback on the [**RedTeam Dashboard**](https://dashboard.theredteam.io)
- Based on scores and feedback, refine and improve your solution.
- Rebuild and republish your docker image with the updated solution.
- Update the `active_commit.yaml` file with the new commit hash.
- Restart the miner node to resubmit the improved solution.

## 5.3. Check your rewards

- After successful scoring and validation, rewards will be distributed to your registered wallet based on your performance.
- Ensure your wallet is secure and monitor your balance regularly.
- Check your wallet balance to see the rewards earned:

```sh
btcli wallet balance \
    --wallet-path <WALLET_PATH> \
    --wallet-name <WALLET_NAME> \
    --wallet-hotkey <WALLET_HOTKEY> \
    --verbose

# For example:
btcli wallet balance \
    --wallet-path ~/.bittensor/wallets \
    --wallet-name my_wallet \
    --wallet-hotkey my_hotkey \
    --verbose
```
