# 4. 🚀 Submit Commit

In this step, you will configure and run your miner node to submit your published commit (Docker image) to the RedTeam Subnet for evaluation.

## Prerequisites

- [**1. Preparation**](./1.preparation.md)
- [**2. Develop Solution**](./2.develop-solution.md)
- [**3. Build and Publish**](./3.build-and-publish.md)

## 4.1. Clone miner node repository

Create a dedicated directory for RedTeam Subnet projects (if not exists):

```sh
# Create projects directory:
mkdir -pv ~/workspaces/projects/redteam61

# Enter into projects directory:
cd ~/workspaces/projects/redteam61
```

Clone the miner repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/miner.git && \
    cd miner
```

## 4.2. Configure active commit file to submit

!!! danger "IMPORTANT"
    Make sure to change the commit hash with your own pushed docker image **SHA256 digest as commit hash** in the **`active_commit.yaml`** file:

```sh
# Copy template active commit file:
cp -v ./templates/configs/active_commit.yaml ./volumes/configs/agent-miner/active_commit.yaml

# Change active commit file with your own commit hash:
nano ./volumes/configs/agent-miner/active_commit.yaml
```

`active_commit.yaml` format:

```yaml
- <CHALLENGE_NAME>---<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>@sha256:<DIGEST>
```

For example:

```yaml
- ab_sniffer_v5---my_username/my_repo@sha256:abc123def456...
- ada_detection_v3---my_username/my_repo@sha256:abc123def456...
```

!!! tip "TIP"
    You can add multiple commits for different challenges in the same `active_commit.yaml` file.

!!! warning "WARNING"
    - Only one commit per challenge is allowed in the `active_commit.yaml` file. If you add multiple commits for the same challenge, only the last one will be considered during submission and others will be ignored.
    - We are allowing only one commit per challenge/day for submission to avoid spam, abuse, unnecessary network load, and fair evaluation for all participants.

## 4.3. Configure environment variables

- You need [Bittensor wallet that registered](../../manuals/bittensor/wallet/register.md) on RedTeam Subnet 61.

!!! danger "IMPORTANT"
    Make sure to change the **wallet directory**, **wallet name**, and **hotkey name** variables in the **`.env`** file to match your wallet and hotkey:

    ```sh
    RT_BTCLI_WALLET_DIR="${HOME}/.bittensor/wallets" # !!! CHANGE THIS TO REAL WALLET DIRECTORY !!!
    RT_MINER_WALLET_NAME="miner" # !!! CHANGE THIS TO REAL MINER WALLET NAME !!!
    RT_MINER_HOTKEY_NAME="default" # !!! CHANGE THIS TO REAL MINER HOTKEY NAME !!!
    ```

```sh
# Copy '.env.example' file to '.env' file:
cp -v ./.env.example ./.env

# Edit environment variables to fit in your environment
nano ./.env
```

## 4.4. Validate docker compose configuration

```sh
# Check docker compose configuration is valid:
./compose.sh validate
# Or:
docker compose config
```

## 4.5. Start miner node to submit

```sh
# Start docker compose:
./compose.sh start -l
# Or:
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans --force-recreate && \
    docker compose logs -f --tail 100
```

!!! warning "IMPORTANT"
    - You need to keep the miner node running continuously to submit solutions and earn rewards during the challenge period (at 2 least days).
    - Stopping the miner node could halt submission communications with validators and affect your earnings.
