# 3. 🏗 Build and Publish

In this step, you will build your solution into a Docker image, publish it to Docker Hub, and obtain the SHA256 digest required for submission.

## Prerequisites

- [**1. Preparation**](./1.preparation.md)
- [**2. Develop Solution**](./2.develop-solution.md)

## 3.1. Build docker image

This step assumes you've already cloned the challenge repository and implemented your solution in the `templates/commit` directory or in your working directory as mentioned in the [previous step](./2.develop-solution.md).

!!! note "Arguments"
    Make sure to replace the placeholders:

    - `<USERNAME>` with your Docker Hub username.
    - `<CHALLENGE_NAME>` with the name of the challenge (e.g., `ab_sniffer`, `ada_detection`, `humanize_behaviour`, etc.).
    - `<VERSION>` with your version tag (e.g., `1.0.0`, `v1`, etc.).

```sh
docker build -t <USERNAME>/<CHALLENGE_NAME>:<VERSION> .
# For example:
docker build -t myuser/ab_sniffer:1.0.0 .
```

## 3.2. Publish docker image

### 3.2.1. Create Docker Hub account

Sign up at <https://hub.docker.com>, if you don't have an account yet.

### 3.2.2. Docker Login

You need to login using your Docker Hub credentials before pushing the image:

```sh
docker login
```

### 3.2.3. Push docker image to Docker Hub

```sh
docker push <USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>:<VERSION>
# For example:
docker push my_username/my_repo:1.0.0
```

### 3.2.4. Get SHA256 digest as commit hash

!!! warning "FOR SUBMISSION"
    Save the SHA256 digest of your pushed docker image, which is required for submission for **miner commit hash**!

```sh
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' <USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>:<VERSION>
# For example:
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' my_username/my_repo:1.0.0
```

Output:

```sh
my_username/my_repo@sha256:abc123def456...
```
