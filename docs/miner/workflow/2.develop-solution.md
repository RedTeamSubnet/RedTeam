# 2. Develop Solution for Challenge

You need to develop a solution for a specific challenge in the RedTeam Subnet. This guide outlines the steps to choose a challenge, set up the environment, and implement your solution.

## Prerequisites

- [**1. Preparation**](./1.preparation.md)

## 2.1. Choose challenge to solve

You need to choose a challenge from the RedTeam Subnet challenges to work on. Each challenge has its own repository and documentation that outlines the requirements and objectives. Browse the list of active challenges and select one that interests you:

- [**RedTeam subnet - challenges**](./../../challenges/README.md):
    - [**Auto Browser Sniffer Challenge**](./../../challenges/ab_sniffer/README.md)
    - [**Anti-Detect Automation Challenge**](./../../challenges/ada_detection/README.md)
    - [**Humanize Behavior Challenge**](./../../challenges/humanize_behaviour/README.md)

## 2.2. Setup challenge environment

Follow the specific challenge documentation from above links or go to the each challenge repository to set up your development environment. Here are the links to clone each challenge repository:

- [**Auto Browser Sniffer Challenge**](https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/ab-sniffer-challenge):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/ab-sniffer-challenge.git && \
    cd ab-sniffer-challenge
```

- [**Anti-Detect Automation Challenge**](https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/ada-detection-challenge):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/ada-detection-challenge.git && \
    cd ada-detection-challenge
```

- [**Humanize Behavior Challenge**](https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/humanize-behaviour-challenge):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/humanize-behaviour-challenge.git && \
    cd humanize-behaviour-challenge
```

## 2.3. Develop your own solution

Start implementing your own solution for the chosen challenge. Refer to the challenge documentation for guidelines, requirements, and evaluation criteria.

Templates:

- **Auto Browser Sniffer Challenge**: <https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/ab-sniffer-challenge/tree/main/templates/commit>
- **Anti-Detect Automation Challenge**: <https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/ada-detection-challenge/tree/main/templates/commit>
- **Humanize Behavior Challenge**: <https://github.com/RedTeamSubnet/humanize-behaviour-challenge/tree/main/templates/commit>

Navigate to the `templates/commit` directory in the cloned challenge repository to find the template structure for your solution as commit:

```sh
cd ./templates/commit

# Start developing your solution here
```

Then implement your solution in there or copy that `templates/commit` directory to your working location as solution, you need that `commit` directory structure for submission later.

## 2.4. Test your solution against challenge

Thoroughly test your solution locally to ensure it meets the challenge requirements and performs as expected, before proceeding to packaging and submission.

Manuals:

- [**Auto Browser Sniffer Challenge**](../../challenges/ab_sniffer/testing_manuals.md)
- [**Anti-Detect Automation Challenge**](../../challenges/ada_detection/testing_manuals.md)
- [**Humanize Behavior Challenge**](../../challenges/humanize_behaviour/testing_manuals.md)

## Next Step

- [**3. Build and Submit**](./3.build-and-submit.md)
