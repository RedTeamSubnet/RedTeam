Miners submit encrypted code solutions to validators, who decrypt and evaluate the submissions after a 24-hour period. This ensures the integrity of the submissions, as the original submission time is preserved, and the solutions cannot be plagiarized. Validators run the submitted code in isolated sandbox environments to ensure accurate and replicable scoring.</p> <p>Points are awarded based on the quality of each solution, compared to the previous best. The system calculates emissions based on the number of points a miner has, with points decaying linearly over a 14-day period. This incentivizes continuous improvement and active participation in solving challenges.</p>"},{"location":"#example-challenge","title":"Example Challenge","text":"<p>For instance, a programming challenge may involve mimicking human language to bypass ai generated content detection algorithms.
